# Event Planner

## Overview

Learing about kotlin and how it works as a programming language, including how the syntax works, how we can import classes across classes, and how their parent/child system works.

It will be an event planner; it allows an event planner/organizer to organize their events, divide tasks, and provide templates for flyers, emails, etc.

Making event planning easier for students who might have other things on their plate.

## Development Environment

We used the Code runner extention for vs code to make sure that we don't have any running errors, the Kotlin extention to see the files that are written in kotlin, and Kotlin Formatter to format the folder so that we can have some organization.

The Kotlin language is an object-oriented language that is used for general application development including Android mobile app development. It is based on the Java language. Kotlin was designed to provide improvements to the Java language while still supporting the Java libraries. We used some basic Java libraries.
